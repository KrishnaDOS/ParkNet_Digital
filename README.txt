groovy classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.15'

In your `android/app/build.gradle`, add this line at the bottom:
groovy apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'


iOS:
Ensure you have `CocoaPods` installed (`brew install cocoapods`), and run:
bash cd ios && pod install && cd ..


Geolocation Permissions
For Android and iOS, you'll need to set up location permissions in their respective configuration files:


Android (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`):
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
	<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>

iOS (`ios/Runner/Info.plist`):
	<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
	<string>We need your location to find nearby parking.</string>
	
How to Run the Project


Make sure all dependencies are installed using `flutter pub get`.
Connect a device or start an emulator.
Run the project using the following command: bash flutter run
The app should now be running on your emulator or connected device.

Troubleshooting

Firebase Connection Issues: Double-check that you have correctly set up the Firebase project and added the configuration files (`google-services.json` or `GoogleService-Info.plist`).
Geolocation Permissions: If location-based features are not working, ensure the app has the correct permissions for accessing location data (both in the app and on the device).
